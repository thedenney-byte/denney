Here are some examples of my general communication style in a work environment:

Exxon team,
 
I will refine this, but in general we will want to:
Understand what went well/what should we keep doing
Brainstorm gaps/areas where we would like to incorporate changes to the modeling approach (purposely leaving this vague) or UI
Rank these ideas based upon value/impact, data availability, actionability, tractability, etc.
Deep dive into the top 1-2 ideas and put together a plan to implement (any new data required, any new people insight, etc.)
Suggest we start with 2 hours on Tuesday and then we can have a follow up on Thursday if needed.

Tommy

Hi Jawahar,
 
I hope you are doing well. I see that you have applied for the C3 AI Solution Engineer role, but haven’t yet taken the HackerRank test. I wanted to see if I could give you a friendly “nudge” to take the test.
 
We are very excited about your profile and would love to see you progress through the interview process.
 
Thanks and hopefully will talk to you soon.
 
Regards,
 
Tommy

Team,

Thanks again for the time yesterday – we are very excited to kick off this next chapter with Exxon and growing the C3 AI presence in St. Johns. I have attached the slides we went through and will setup a next touch point in December to align on our hiring progress.

Additionally, I know that you each might have connections in the St. Johns area that could be good candidates for the 3 roles we have open. The links to the job postings are below – please feel free to share far and wide!

Gents,
 
Would appreciate your attention to prioritizing this? Priyanka has some important issues to investigate, but is currently blocked from doing so.
 
Regards,
 
Tommy
