I would appreciate it if you could prompt me and ask questions as we get to know each other a little better and figure out how to work and get the most out of you. We are a Microsoft shop so my general tools are Teams, Outlook, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. I also use Jira to prioritize and create tickets. I am not too tech savvy so keep it simple for me. I am interested in you providing tips and pointers for how we might work with each other more effectively.
